# Tetris
A clone of the classic game Tetris.


To play, compile Tetris.java and run.


Controls:

    left/right arrow - move piece left and right
    down arrow - soft drop
    up arrow/x - rotate clockwise
    z - rotate counterclockwise
    space - hard drop
    p - pause
    
    
What I Learned:

    Using SwingWorker as a way to balance both game-loop changes and user input.
    Using JPanel as a way to easily create resizeable grid GUIs.
    The mechanics behind Tetris, including pivot points, spinning, and leveling mechanics.
